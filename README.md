# awesome-packages

I tend to forgot the packages & gists / just too lazy to scan every package.json files from my recent projects / 
too lazy to scan on my starred repositories since I starred a lot on github.
So,  I have decided to list the packages I used on some of my projects and the packages I just find helpful for me.
